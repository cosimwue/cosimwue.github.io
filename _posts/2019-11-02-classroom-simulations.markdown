For the past ten years we have developed conflict simulations for a wide range of application in academic education and employed them in class. They range from simple, small-scale simulations designed to illustrate a specific aspect of a political or military conflict of the past to large and complex simulations aimed at providing participants with some experience of general issues related to political and military decision making.

The largest and most complex simulation we currently employ is an army corps level simulation called "Pluie de Balles" or PdB for short. PdB is aimed both at university students and at other early-career decision makers, both military and civilian. It is designed to expose the participants to some of the friction that is caused by having to process information, make decisions and communicate under stress, as well as to test the limits of the participants' capability of working together as a team. We have run PdB successfully on a regular basis with groups of up to 40 or more participants from both a civilian and a military background. Despite its slightly unusual setting - PdB scenarios are usually based on Victorian invasion novel literature - participants regularly describe their experiences as highly illuminating though, due to the stress involved, not always exactly enjoyable.

A more detailed description of Pluie de Balles and other simulations developed by us will follow soon. A brief overview over PdB and its purpose can be found in our publication [*Pluie de Balles - complex wargames in the classroom*](http://analoggamestudies.org/2018/09/pluie-de-balles-complex-wargames-in-the-classroom/).
