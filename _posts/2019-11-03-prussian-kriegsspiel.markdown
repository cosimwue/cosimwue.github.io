In 1824, a Prussian Army lieutenant named Georg Heinrich von Reisswitz published a set of rules for what he called a *Kriegsspiel* (German for "war game") that soon after would be called "a school of war" by an enthusiasic  [Karl von Müffling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Freiherr_von_M%C3%BCffling), then chief of the general staff in Berlin. Reisswitz's game was revolutionary in several ways. Abandoning traditional chess-like game boards it was played on the time's state-of-the-art topographic maps, it introduced umpires (*Vertraute*), and mechanics that allowed to simulate fog-of-war experience and communicative friction. During the decades that followed the *Kriegsspiel* in its many incarnations developed after Reisswitz became a common peace-time occupation among Prussian officers, and the surprising success of Prussia's army in the wars between 1864 and 1871 - one of their most promiment protagonists, [Helmuth von Moltke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Elder), was a fervant devotee of the *Kriegsspiel* - were followed by its adoption in most industrialized nations before World War I.

The Conflict Simulation Group at the University of Würzburg has collected a a majority of the *Kriegsspiel* rule sets published between 1824 and 1914, conducted research on the *Kriegsspiel* and its role in 19th century military thinking and education, and organized *Kriegsspiel* sessions with recontructed materials on different scales, proabably for the first time in decades. Research articles on the topic can be found in the [publications](/2019/11/01/publications.html) section.

## Playing the *Kriegsspiel*
The *Kriegsspiel* is played on a topographic map. Units are represented with tokens, originally made from lead, that depict contemporary, i.e. non-standardized, tactical symbols. It simulates land operations from brigade level upwards. The teams playing the *Kriegsspiel* are placed in separate rooms, each with its own map and set of tokens. The players do not need to know the rules of the game at all, they simply write orders orders to imaginated subordinates and receive written messages in reply imitating the actions at a real command post in the field. They rely on the map and tokens to depict the tactical situation how they perceive it.

[An introduction to the use of the contemporary map and unit tokens can be seen here.]

A team of **umpires** (*Vertraute*) based in another room is tasked with processing orders and writing messages players would receive from subordinate commanders. It is the umpires who solve conflicts according to the mechanisms outlined in the rules. Their map is the only one that depicts the *reality* of the simulation, whereas the player maps only show the teams' assessments of the situation accoding to the information available to them. The quality and amount of information the players get is controlled by the umpiring team, depending on the situation, by simulating the decisions and communications of the command levels subordinate to that of the players.

Thanks to these features, the *Kriegsspiel* provided a relatively realistic exercice in staff work during ongoing operations, information processing, efficient communication and decision making with uncomplete or unrelyable information about the situation.

## Recreating the battle of Königgrätz
The largest sessions organized by the Conflict Simulation Group simulated the southern wing's actions at the [Battle of Königgrätz in 1866](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_K%C3%B6niggr%C3%A4tz) where two complete army corps engaged each other. These games, based on a set of ruled published by Wilhelm von Tschischwitz in 1867, involved about 40 participants. The setting allows for the depiction of multiple command levels: each team is split into one army corps HQ and five division level commands, each invested with a separate map and set of tokens. Army corps commanders have to assess the situation, decide, and formulate orders accoring to the written messages they receive from division level commanders. That way, many aspects of staff work in army corps level operations can be simulated.
