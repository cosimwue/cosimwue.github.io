An operational simulation inspired by the Prussians' *Strategisches Kriegsspiel* (strategic war game), *Twelve Days to London* recreates general staff work in a fictional 19th century conflict. In a scenario based on Victorian invasion scare literature as well as real contemporary wargaming scenarios, participant teams experience the operational level of command. The goal of the blue invading force is to land on the shores of Britain and take the city of London before the Royal Navy can return from its overseas deployment, the window of opportunity will last only for twelve daysâ€¦

After initial trials in the classroom, a first play-by-email implementation on a real-time, one-turn-a-day basis is about to happen in April 2020.
